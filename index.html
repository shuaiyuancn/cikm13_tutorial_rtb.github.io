	  	<h3>Abstract</h3>

	  	<p>Online advertising is now one of the fastest advancing areas in IT industry. In display and mobile advertising, the most significant development in recent years is the growth of Real-Time Bidding (RTB), which allows selling and buying online display advertising in real-time one ad impression at a time. Since then, RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of the digital media market by scaling the buying process across a large number of available inventories. It also encourages behaviour (re-)targeting, and makes a significant shift toward buying focused on user data, rather than contextual data. <a href="http://goo.gl/OCK8E">A report from IDC</a> shows that in 2011, global RTB based display ad spend increased by 237% compared to 2010, with the U.S.’s $2.2 billion RTB display spend leading the way. The market share of RTB-based spending of all display ad spending will grow from 10% in 2011 to 27% in 2016, and its share of all indirect spending will grow from 28% to 78%.</p>

		<p>Scientifically, the further demand for automation, integration and optimization in RTB brings new research opportunities in the CIKM fields. For instance, the much enhanced flexibility of allowing advertisers and agencies to maximize impact of budgets by more optimised buys based on their own or 3rd party (user) data makes the online advertising market a step closer to the financial markets, where unification and interconnection are strongly promoted.  The unification and interconnections across webpages, advertisers, and users require significant research on knowledge management, data mining, information retrieval, behaviour targeting and their links to game theory, economics and optimization. </p>

		<p>Despite its rapid growth and huge potential, many aspects of RTB remain unknown to the research community for a variety of reasons. In this tutorial, teamed up with presenters from both the industry and academia, we aim to bring the insightful knowledge from the real-world systems, to bridge the gaps between industry and academia, and to provide an overview of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms, and technical and research challenges of the new frontier of computational advertising.</p>

		<h3>Aims and Learning objectives</h3>

		<p>This tutorial aims to provide not only a comprehensive and systemic introduction to RTB and computational advertising in general, but also the emerging research challenges and research tools and datasets in order to facilitate the research. Compared to previous Computational Advertising tutorials in relevant top-tier conferences, this tutorial takes a fresh, neutral, and the latest look of the field and focuses on the fundamental changes brought by RTB. </p>

		<p>We will begin by giving a brief overview of the history of online advertising and present the current eco-system in which RTB plays an increasingly important part. Based on our field study and the DSP optimisation contest organised by iPinyou, we analyse optimization problems both from the demand side (advertisers) and the supply side (publishers), as well as the auction mechanism design challenges for Ad exchanges. We discuss how IR, DM and ML techniques have been applied to these problems. In addition, we discuss why game theory is important in this area and how it could be extended beyond the auction mechanism design.</p>

		<p>CIKM is an ideal venue for this tutorial because RTB is an area of multiple disciplines, including information retrieval, data mining, knowledge discovery and management, and game theory, most of which are traditionally the key themes of the conference. As an illustration of practical application in the real world, we shall cover algorithms in the iPinyou global DSP optimisation contest on a production platform; for the supply side, we also report experiments of inventory management, reserve price optimisation, etc. in production systems.</p>

		<p>We expect the audience, after attending the tutorial, to understand the real-time online advertising mechanisms and the state of the art techniques, as well as to grasp the research challenges in this field. Our motivation is to help the audience acquire domain knowledge and obtain relevant datasets, and to promote research activities in RTB and computational advertising in general. </p>

		<h2>Description of topics</h2>

		<p>The demand side Web advertising has long promised to provide marketers with a more objective measurement of its value than print or television marketing. Indeed, a large percentage of display and mobile ads are valued on the basis of how often users convert on an advertiser's offer — such as buying a product, signing up for a service, or downloading an app [39]. With the emergence of RTB, the calculations of the probability of such events have become more and more precise. Thus, it would appear that online, advertisers only pay for campaigns and inventory that work. Therefore, a natural challenge is to allocate budgets to high performance inventories and segments, where a general exploration and exploitation dilemma is introduced [42]. Besides, since conversions occur separately from the display of the ads themselves and because many ads can be seen before conversions occur, a choice must be made as to how to attribute conversions to an ad or among ads. Given the scale of RTB, simply assigning the conversion to the most recent associated ad—known as last touch attribution—is a common choice, even though it is known to be an imperfect option. In addition, some marketers prefer to split conversion attribution among all associated ads. Assigning attribution across ads presents additional analytical and technical challenges that the ad tech industry has yet to fully address [37].</p>

		<p>One could argue that, from the perspective of advertisers, the value of an ad should be its causal influence on total sales (less its costs) [38]. However, few advertisers or networks today implement the type of control randomized display of ads that would facilitate valid causal inference or look at sales lift beyond conversions. In the abstract, the ideal design for a more valid and holistic assessment of the performance of marketing is known and industry and researchers have collaborated to solve the problem in some instances . However, implementing an experimental methodology at scale ¬(for many different types of advertisers and campaigns) while also optimizing individual level response rates requires a lot more effort. Ad Exchanges such as AppNexus are engaged in the initial steps of implementing experimental methodology at scale, but much works remains to be done and many opportunities for collaboration are available.</p>

		<p>The supply side In the online advertising eco-system, yield optimisation is the core problem of the supply side, aka, publishers, and is commonly dealt with by managing revenue channels [28]; selecting relevant ads [36]; optimising reserve prices [25, 29]; controlling advertising level [11], etc. The community has focused largely on inventory management, especially handling guaranteed contracts with overlapping targeting [9, 15], and balancing between these contracts and non-guaranteed deliveries [28]. In addition, some researchers have compared popular pricing models, such as Cost Per Mille (CPM), Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) [18, 21, 19, 14] and offered suggestions for optimizing among them.</p>

		<p>With the emergence of RTB publishers are given more freedom to manage their inventories at a finer granularity. For instance, to set optimal reserve prices (sometimes referred to as hard floor prices) dynamically as a function of private valuations based on the context, or even towards a specific buyer [24, 25]. If the second price auction is used and the reserve price is between the first and second highest bids, the winner has to pay more than without a reserve price. On the other hand, the soft floor prices are also popular in modern exchanges [40]. Unlike hard floor prices, the soft ones are usually hidden. If it is higher than the highest bid, the publisher always charges the winner what he has bid but without the risk of failing the auction. That is, by setting a high soft floor price, the publisher can easily switch from the second price auction to the first price one, which leads to the debate of which auction mechanism is superior in the real world [17, 3]. The Generalised Second Price auction (GSP) has been considered the de facto standard for long, however it is not always true in the RTB scenario where publishers have more control. In fact, in the auction dataset that we plan to report, there are 40% first price auctions taking 55% of total advertisers’ budgets [40].</p>

		<p>Datasets and evaluation For the purpose of evaluation and promote research in the field, we will also cover iPinYou global DSP optimisation contest , which kicked off on April 1, 2013 and will end no later than December 31, 2013. The purpose of this competition is to improve DSP bidding algorithms, stimulate the interest of research and development of RTB algorithms in the whole data science research community, and speed up the growth of RTB-enabled display advertising ecosystem. During online evaluation, iPinYou opens its DSP platform and embeds participants' algorithms to live bid ad impressions for advertisers. So far, the competition has attracted several hundred participants from 7 countries and the first milestone prize has been awarded to a team from Chinese Academy of Science. Princeton University, University of California at Santa Cruz, and Beijing University have adapted the competition as the course project. To facilitate the research in RTB, in this tutorial, we shall introduce the competition and examine the formal evaluation and datasets. </p>

		<h3>Research context</h3>

		<p>Before the emergence of RTB in 2009 (i.e., announcement of support by major ad exchanges [16]), the display advertising market was primarily divided between so-called premium and remnant sales channels. In the premium marketplace which covered approximately 40% of impressions, publishers would and still do negotiate and make deals with advertisers directly. Advertisers propose to buy a certain amount of impressions from select placements, regardless of the identities of users, when and how many times they have seen the ad, and so on. From the advertisers’ perspective, the purchase of premium inventory is about the aggregate quality and quantity of impressions and relies on the reputation of the publisher and reported audience profiles [10, 5, 1]. Thus, publishers need to guarantee the delivery of impressions that have been agreed upon otherwise a penalty fee would be incurred [28, 30]. The pricing models used in premium contracts are mostly Cost Per Mille (CPM). Since advertisers have no control over the inventories or users, it is more difficult to deploy goal-driven campaigns (e.g. booking a ticket) than branding ones (e.g. announcing a new product). These contracts are sometimes called guaranteed display advertising [4].</p>

		<p>Remnant inventory, by contrast, was traditionally sold through ad networks. Publishers would register their placements with networks and offer impressions for sale. Networks would sell impressions largely via second price auctions among their registered advertisers. However the impressions in ad networks are non-guaranteed, as opposed to premium contracts.</p>

		<p>Thus, it was and still is the ad network’s responsibility to understand the webpage and the user, and to select advertisers based on their pre-defined targeting rules. The understanding of webpage is usually referred to as contextual advertising, where ad networks crawl, parse, and extract keywords which summarise the target [41]. Advertisers bid on these keywords which is very similar to sponsored search [27, 35, 2, 32]. A more advanced approach is to learn a model including various features of webpages, which could then be used to compute a relevance score of advertisers’ targeting criteria [20, 6, 7]. The understanding of user is usually referred to as behavioural targeting, where ad networks utilise the browsing history of a specific user to infer his interests, as well as geographical location, local time, etc. for target matching [34, 26, 33].</p>

		<p>In ad networks advertisers largely adopt the Cost Per Click (CPC) or Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) pricing models where they only pay when certain goal is achieved. These choices reduce their risks and thus are good for goal-driven campaigns. But then it is ad networks’ responsibility to optimise to maximise clicks or conversions. In order to take the measurement of performance into account, ad networks usually employ the Generalised Second Price auction (GSP) [12] which allow them to apply bid biases (e.g. the quality score) that usually weight the historical Click Through Rate (CTR) or Conversion Rate (CVR) heavily.</p>

		<p>For the supply side, an important research topic is how to allocate impressions between guaranteed contracts and non-guaranteed ad networks/exchanges [30, 28, 13]. When selling via guaranteed contrasts, publishers need to decide which specific contract to fulfil when multiple contracts having overlapping targeting rules. It is possible that ad networks bring in more revenue, but if a publisher sends too many impressions to this revenue channel and fails to fulfil a contract, he needs to pay a good- will penalty. </p>

		<p>When there were more and more ad networks, the excessive impressions in some of them led to the birth of ad exchanges. It is preferable to have more demand than supply because intense competition leads to higher revenue of both ad networks and publishers. However, when there are plenty of impressions unsold, ad networks try hard to find buyers even at low prices. Besides, a common practice for advertisers was to register with multiple ad networks to find cheap inventories, or at least to find enough impressions within their budget constraints. They only found that managing numerous channels difficult and inefficient (e.g. how to split the budget). Ad exchanges, like Google AdX, Yahoo! Right Media, Microsoft ad exchange, and AppNexus were created to address this problem by connecting hundreds of ad networks together. Advertisers then have a higher chance to locate enough impressions with preferred targeting rules. Publishers may receive higher profit too because more demand competes for their inventory.</p>

		<p>There are new research problems introduced by ad exchanges. In the pioneer work of [23] the author discussed several issues including the truthfulness of auctions [22], call-out optimisation [8], arbitrage bidding and risk analysis, etc. There are also noteworthy attempts to introduce concepts from finance market [31] which would make the ad exchange more mature and attractive.</p>

		<p>When advertisers want to take advantage of RTB, they work with ad exchanges through 3rd party platform that are usually referred to as the Demand Side Platform (DSP). DSPs are delegates of advertisers that answer bidding requests and optimise campaigns at the impression level. At the other end, the Supply Side Platform (SSP) was created to serve publishers. Similarly, SSPs provide a central management console with various tools for publishers’ ultimate goal — the yield optimisation. </p>

		<p>To give more examples of the potential research challenges, consider the following: SSPs normally do not query data exchanges for 3rd party user data. However, if publishers could understand and model specific users, they will be in a better position of yield optimisation (e.g. setting up an optimal reserve price for this auction based on the forecast of bidding activity with user data), although such query would incur cost. Meanwhile, ad exchanges normally do not send impressions to each other even if they remain unsold. This is largely due to business considerations and it leads to the fact that DSPs and SSPs register with multiple ad exchanges. A unified and interconnected marketplace is what we find attractive and it is certainly good for the whole eco-system.</p>
